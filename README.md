# quiz

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

Summary of app structure:
1. The process of this quiz app is first, users will be asked to give a username.
2. The username will be used to assossiate with the history and scores of the quiz stored locally.
3. After inserting username, the user will be able to choose to start the quiz, which will later on be asked to choose a category, or to view the history.
4. The quiz will be based on the category which was sorted in the Trivia API.

Some fail attempts while writing the code:
1. I wanted to use firebase to store the user credentials in a secured manner but there were some errors which I could not debug until now. (I will update this repository if I manage to debug it)
2. Same issue with firebase, I wasn't able to sign up user using google accounts.
